# Infiltrators - Game rules

INFILTRATORS is a tactical game where 1 player plays the guard and 1 or more players control individual infiltrators trying to accomplish missions on the guard's territory. 


## Setup

1. Get a table.
2. Decide who plays the guard and who plays the infiltrator(s). Only 1 player can play the guard.
3. Set up the board by picking 4 board segments and place them next to each other. Infiltrator and guard players take turns laying down area cards, starting with the guard player.
4. Infiltrator players pick one infiltrator character card and randomly draw 3 equipment cards. Players discard the least useful equipment card and lay the character card and equipment cards face up on the table. Players pick the character figure that corresponds to the character card.
5. The guard player picks a number of guard character cards. The number of guard character cards is the amount of infiltrator players times 3. Then the guard player picks up the figures that correspond to the guard character cards.
6. The guard player positions the guards' figures on the board. They can be positioned anywhere on the 4 board segments.
7. Agree which direction on the game board is "fictional north" and mark it with the compass rose tile in a place where everyone can see it.
8. The guard player places objective markers on the board segments according to the campaign mission details. If no specific mission is played, the guard player places 3 objective markers on the board with a maximum of 1 objective per board segment.
9. The infiltrator characters start their first turn from a tile on the edge of the board. It can be any tile as long as there is no obstacle (walls, etc.) marked between the tile and the physical edge of the board. Infiltrators players take their figures and place them on the desired tiles. From then the first round is played out.



## Game overview

Over the course of a game, the infiltrators enter the board and move to accomplish their mission objectives. Mission objectives can vary but usually include hacking into 2 out of 3 terminals placed on the board and escaping with all infiltrators unharmed and before the General Alert is issued.

When either the infiltrators have exfiltrated or the General Alert gets issued, players calculate their points score for the game. Whoever has the most points after that, wins.

Infiltrators can be played as a campaign with several missions in a row. Players will be able to trade points for equipment in between games. Whoever has the most points after the campaign ends, wins.


## Game progress

Every round starts with the infiltrator players taking their turns. The turn order is dictated by the movement score on the players' character cards, starting with the player whose character has the highest. A character can execute 2 actions in every turn.

When the infiltrator players have finished taking their actions, the guard player may activate as many of her characters as there are Alert tokens. Each of these characters may take 2 actions. Guard characters that were not activated may then perform one _random movement action_ in any order the guard player wishes. When the guard player has finished doing actions with his characters, a new round can begin.


## Turn actions

When taking a turn, a character can execute 2 actions. An action can be of the following:

* Move the figure
* Perform a ranged attack on another character figure
* Perform a hand to hand attack on another character figure
* Hack a computer terminal

Actions can be combined in any way the player wishes - even repeated after another. Sometimes, taking an action involves a _skill check_. For a skill check, the player picks up as many D6 dice as she has skill points and rolls them. Any die showing a 5 or a 6 counts as a success.


### Move action

Consult the character card. The character's "Movement" skill indicates the maximum number of tiles a character can move in one move action.

Move the character figure in a path on the board for any number of tiles up the maximum allowed.

Figures can move from tile to tile in both straight and diagonal paths and around obstacles. A move path cannot go though a tile occupied by another figure or obstacles, or tiles separated by walls.


### Random movement action

Usually, the guard player's figures cannot all be activated but remaining figures may always take one _random movement action._ When taking a random movement action for a figure, roll a die. Consult the compass. The die result will indicate which compass direction to move your figure in:

1,6: Reroll
2: North
3: East
4: South
5: West

Move the figure in that direction. The figure may move a number of tiles up to it's maximum movement skill.

The guard player can decide to skip the move if the direction doesn't suit her. Then the figure remains on it's original position and can make no more actions this round.



### Shooting

Your characters carry guns and will be able use actions to fire them at opponents.

Consult the character card to see if it has the ability to perfom a ranged attack. There should be a number marked with 'R'. The character should have some equipment (bow, throwing knife, etc.) that enables it to perfom a ranged attack. Otherwise the attack cannot be perfomed.

If both equipment and ranged ability is present, declare a target figure. The target must be within range of the ranged equipment being used and a ranged attack can only be done over a straight path of tiles with no obstacles in between them. 

Collect as many dice as the character's ranged ability indicates + ranged bonuses from the equipment used. Roll the dice and note the number of 5s and 6s rolled. Those are hits. Place the hit dice on your target's character card. 


---

### Performing a close combat attack (melee)

Consult the character card to see if it has the ability to perfom a close combat attack. There should be a number marked with 'C'.

If the ability is present, declare a target figure. The target figure must be adjacent to the attacking figure with no obstacles in between them. Attacks can be perfomed diagonally. No special equipment is necessary for a close combat attack.

Collect as many dice as the character's close combat ability indicates + bonuses from any equipment used. Roll the dice and note the number of 5s and 6s rolled. Those are hits. Place the hit dice on your target's character card. 


### Ganging up

Infiltrator characters perfoming an attack can add 1 additional die to their attack dice if another infiltrator figure is standing in a position where he/she can attack the same target.


## Death check

During play a character will be attacked numerous times and accumulate hit dice on its character card. If, after an attack, the number of hit dice on the card are more than the number indicated by its health ability (the number marked with 'HP'), the character must perfom a death check.

Death checks are perfomed by taking a number of hit dice being the current amount of hit dice minus the character's health ability and rolling those dice. If any die comes out a 5 or a 6, the character is taken out and can be removed from the board. If no 5s or 6s are rolled, put the dice back on the character card and continue with the character in play.


## Stealth

Infiltrators can apply stealth to accomplish their missions - either by avoiding noise or working in the shadows.


### Shadows

If a infiltrator character's figure stands on a board tile that is shaded (marked with a dark colour) and performs an attack, he/she gets to roll 1 additional die. An infiltrator character standing on a shaded tile cannot be attacked by guard characters unless the infiltrator has *made some noise*.


### Noise

If an infiltrator character attacks a guard or ends its move action on a board tile that is not shaded, the character produces noise. Place a die next to the character's figure on the board to indicate noise. More noise dice are added if the character continues doing noisy actions.

Some equipment cards that infiltrators can use, will be labelled as "silent". Using this equipment when performing an attack will not produce noise. Thus no noise die is added.

An infiltrator with 1 or more noise dice attached can always be attacked by guards - even if he/she is *standing in the shadows.*

Noise dice can be removed again from the character under the following circumstances,

* If an infiltrator character has noise dice at the start of its turn, remove 1 noise die.
* If a guard character performs an attack on an infiltrator, the guard can remove 1 noise die from the infiltrator and add it to his/hers attack dice.


## Game end

The game ends when all infiltrators have left the board or have been incapacitated. Infiltrators and defenders tally points according to the mission objectives. Whoever has the most points win.
